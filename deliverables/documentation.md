## Documentation

All projects will require video, photo, diagramatic and written documentation to be submitted in a single post on the class [Gallery]({{site.gallery}}). For most projects, the quality of documentation is part of the grading rubric.

- Video:
  - Thoughtful lighting - use lamps, lighting equipment or natural light. Avoid shooting final documentation in the lab using flourescent lights
  - Use a tripod! Handheld video rarely turns out well.
  - Take process documentation! Remember to take video of the work as you're developing it.
  - Use text or voice-over to help the viewer understand what they are watching
  - Concise and to the point - viewers should be able to understand the big picture of your project without having to read accompanying text.
  - Examples of beautiful video documentation:
    - [Solar Petals - Clifford, Weaver, Marsico](https://vimeo.com/103103839)
    - [Tactum - Madeline Gannon](https://vimeo.com/121804034)
    - [Guardian Spark - Dan Russo](https://vimeo.com/142989470)
- Photography:
  - Use a tripod
  - Use DSLR whenever you can
  - Shoot as much as you can.
  - Consider composition: what are you trying to show the viewer?
  - When shooting architecture or larger projects, keep your [lines parallel!](http://blog.nicgranleese.com/2013/11/12/how-to-get-horizontal-lines-parallel-in-architectural-photography/)
- Diagrams:
  - Can you draw a simplified version of the project using simple lines and shapes?
  - What components exist?
  - What is the data flow?
  - How does the feedback loop work?
- Writing:
  - What can you tell the reader that they can't infer from images, video and diagrames?
  - Be concise. Do not ramble.
  - Do not philosophise unless you actually have something meaningful to say.
  - No BS.
