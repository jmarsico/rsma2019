<h2 id="reading-1-introduction-to-the-iot-and-connected-products">Reading 1: Introduction to the IoT and Connected Products</h2>

<h4 id="mark-weiser-1991-the-computer-for-the-21st-century-scientific-american-pp-94104"><em>Mark Weiser (1991) The computer for the 21st century. Scientific American, pp. 94–104.</em></h4>

<p class="message">
Context:
Weiser's paper is the cananonical introduction to the ubiqutious computing vision. Introduced in 1991, it explores paradigm shifts required for and future directions in computing that lead to the IoT and connected environments we're familiar with today.
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Why is the notion of a ‘personal’ computer misplaced and why should computing ‘disappear’?</li>
  <li>Weiser’s paper closes with the statement: <em>“Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.”</em> Why is this significant?</li>
  <li>The article is now  more than 25 years old. How does Weiser’s vision align with the world of connectivity, embeded and smart computing that we have today. Have we achieved the vision or is there work remaining?</li>
</ul>

<p class="message">
Context:
David Rose introduced some of the earliest commercially available internet appliances. He founded Ambient Devices and produced the ambient orb and umbrella and went on to found Vitality a company that produced a smart pill cap to help enhance adherance to medications. This book is design-centered exploring at the strategies, considerations, and approaches for successful interactions and the creation of beloved internet appliances.
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Much lke Weiser, Roses offers a critique of personal computing. How do they overlap and what are the differences?</li>
  <li>“<em>What is the most natural and desirable-even invisible-way for human beings to interact with technology without requiring a new set of skills or constantly needing to learn new languages, gestures, icons, color codes, or button combinations?”</em> Why is this a fundamental question that informs the design of IoT applications?</li>
  <li>Why are trends for internet appliances and why are enchanted objects ‘avatar for services’?</li>
  <li>“<em>The enchanted objects that will succeed will be the ones that carry on the traditions and promises of the objects of our age-old fantasies, the ones that connect with and satisfy our fundamental human desires.”</em> Do you agree?</li>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>How would you define an ambient display?  How do they relate to ‘calm technology’?</li>

<p class="message">
Context:

Genevieve Bell has written extensively on the need to considering the 'messiness' of the world around us, as well as social and cultural considerations, in today's IoT e.g. 'Divining a Digital Mess'. This paper explores the introduction of 'smart' domestic technology through the lens of the kitchen.
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“Most new domestic technologies embody notions of efficiency—designed to improve time and resource management.”</em>  Why is a focus on efficiency, ergonomics and simplicity problematic in the design of domestic technology?</li>
  <li>Compare and contrast the corporate vision of ‘smart homes’ offered on page 52 and the case studies in Italy and German (pages 55-57), what are the differences and distinctions?</li>
  <li>“We have argued that it is necessary to disentangle the kitchen—and by extension other domestic spaces—from the relentless rhetoric and logic of the smart house.” Why is this the case and do you agree?</li>

Context:
A 2014 article that questions the need to reconsider the dominant IoT vision as objects talking to objects and include an emphasis on objects as important mediators and actors in social relationships.
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Why are objects inherently social things and why does this matter for the IoT?</li>
  <li><em>“As designers of interactive technologies we need to take account of a world that is already replete with material artifacts that we have established relationships with and maintain relationships through”</em><br />
How can designers help enhance the ‘social capacity’ of smart objects?</li>

<h2 id="reading-4-considering-connectivity">Reading 4: Considering Connectivity</h2>

<p class="message">
Context:
Greenfield's 2006 book poses a series of short reflections on the (potential) impact of Ubiquitous computing. He critically examines the questions _we should ask_ of these technologies as they become more prevalent. It's a fascinating read and provides an excellent lens on the technical, moral, social and ethical considerations involved in designing and deploying IoT solutions.

Peachpit Press, Berkeley, CA, USA.</h5>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Greenfield poses a series of issues we need to be aware of. Which of them do you feel is the most pressing concern and why?</li>
  <li>Thesis 41 poses the complexity of IoT device interactions: ‘when interconnected, they will assuredly interact in emergent and unpredictable ways.” Why is this a problem unique to the IoT and how could it be mitigated?</li>
  <li>“Everyware produces a wide belt of circumstances where human agency, judgment, and will are progressively supplanted by compliance with external, frequently algorithmically-applied, standards and norms.” Consider the positive and negative aspects of this.</li>
</ul>

Adam Greenfield. 2006. <em>Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing</em>. Peachpit Press, Berkeley, CA, USA.</h5>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on this text, are our prerogatives being safeguarded by today’s consumer IoT? Why?</li>
  <li>Why and how should everywhere default to harmlessness?</li>
  <li>It closes: <em>“These principles are necessary but not sufficient: they constitute not an end, but a beginning.”</em>. What other safeguards do you believe are needed?</li>
  <li>After finishing this text return to the question originally posed at the start of the chapter: <em>“How can we as designers, users, consumers, ensure that everywhere contains provisions preserving our quality of life and safeguarding our fundamental perogatives?”</em></li>

Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA.</h5>

<p class="message">
Context:
We revisit Reading 1 and Weiser's UbiComp vision with 'a manifesto and partly a progress report' by Dourish and Bell. They critically reflect on the state of Ubicomp to explore what might and should come next.
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>“Today, ubicomp research is characterized primarily by a concern with potential future computational worlds—what we call the “proximate future””. From the authors’ perspective, what is the problem with the proximate future and how should we understand the relationship between ubicomp’s envisioned future and our everyday present?</li>
  <li>Why is ubicomp all about messiness and why is this messiness important?</li>
  <li>In your opinion, is the lens better set the present or the future when we envision internet appliances?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="six-future-fantasies---from-from-david-rose-2014-enchanted-objects-design-human-desire-and-the-internet-of-things-scribner">Six Future Fantasies - from from David Rose (2014) Enchanted Objects: Design, Human Desire and The Internet of Things, Scribner.</h5>

<p class="message">
Context:
In the closing chapter of Rose's Enchanted Objects, he speculates on six ways internet appliances will change the way we encounter technology in our lives
</p>

<p><em>Framing Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the 6 fantasties (on-demand, calm, hackability, learning, digital shadows, and subversion)?</li>
  <li>How much of these fantasies has already arrived, and how much do we still need to design?</li>
  <li>Do you share Rose’s optimism that they’ll lead us into <em>“enchanted realms and ecosystems that impact how we live, learn, and interact with each other and the world”</em> Why?</li>
</ul>
