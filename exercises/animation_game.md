> **tl;dr** How can we communicate with extremely simple animation? Maybe this silly group game will help us practice.

1. Download and open this simple [TouchDesigner network](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18m8ri8tulpFQ4ghiVlxlpEsujXNocPit)
2. Break up into two teams.
3. Take ten minutes to have each member write down simple emotions, characteristics, adjectives that one could possibly animate with a single circle and static color. Write each example on a card and place it face down in a pile on your side of the table.
4. Alternating teams every round, one "animator" selects a card from the other team's pile and has 15 seconds to think about how they can animate the card using only color and motion of a single circle.
5. Teams have 1 minute to guess what was on the card.

**BONUS** After round-play, choose one of the most successful animations and try to plot the xy coordinates of the animation.
