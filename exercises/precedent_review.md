title: "Group Precedent Review - Language Extraction"
---

> **tl;dr** We need to start developing a vocabulary to describe the work we'll be doing in this class. Look at precedent documentation to learn how other groups/studios/artists are talking about their work.


# Group Share - 20 minutes
Break up into groups of 5 people. Each person will present their precedent research from the previous week. Presenters should talk about the work in their own words, describing it as they see fit.

# Vocabulary Extraction - 10 minutes
After everyone has presented, each student should research the other 4 projects in their group and pull out phrases or particular words that they think are particularly useful/informative/poignant. Write down each phrase or word on a new sticky note and stick it to the table.

# Vocab Grouping - 10 minutes
As a team, try to organize the words and phrases into functional groups. These groups can be whatever you think makes sense.
