# Introduction

Over the past 10 weeks we have learned how to work with several types of scalable media, including projection mapping and pixel mapping. We have learned to interface with sensors and microcontrollers as well as how to layer and use sound in space. 
The primary requirement for the final project is that groups think big and make the most out of the site. Rather than imagine a particular client or proposal, groups will use the final project site as a gallery space to create a project of their choosing. Similar to previous projects, installations must consider the existing architecture and be site-specific. Works do not **need** to be interactive, but must utilize some form of input data. That could be a static dataset, an image collection, a live API, sensor data, audio or video input, etc.

# Deliverables + Dates

### **One-Liners**: Wednesday, Nov 13 end of class
Each group develops 10 "one-liners" in [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/), one slide per one-liner. Each one-liner includes:
1. A very brief ONE LINE description of the concept
2. A bulleted "how it works" explanation
3. A chosen site within or outside 3577 Studios.

### **Design Presentation and Post**: Wednesday, Nov 20 beginning of class
One week following the one-liners, each team will present a single concept and design. Teams will pitch their concept to the class and make a gallery post with the following contents:
1. Written desription of the concept and design
2. Drawing/rendering/visualization of the concept _as it will be built_. 
3. Mood board that helps viewers understand materiality, concept, precedent.
4. Technical architecture diagram
5. BOM - Each team will have a budget. We need to know as soon as possible what parts need to be ordered.

### **Prototype Presentation**: Monday, Dec 2 beginning of class
Each group will demo a functioning prototype of the technical side of the project. This means that proof-of-concept software, mechanics and electronics need to be working during the demo. This is also a time to show the class your material and form design as it stands. If you are unclear what counts for "functioning prototype" in the context of your project, please discuss with Jake before it's too late.

### **Build Out On Site**: December 7 - 8
Starting the morning of December 7 through class time on December 9, groups will be on-site finishing last minute buildout and installing their works. This is NOT a time to build the project. The expectation is that 90% of the project is built on campus and then transported to the site for the final installation. If you need help with transporting your work, talk to Jake and we'll arrange something.

### **Presentation and Party***: December 9 6:30pm
Presentations begin promptly at 6:30pm. Teams will not be allowed to work on their project after 6:30pm. Invite your friends, we'll run through demos and presentations and then have a party. Jake will bring food and drink. Bring more food if you want.

### **Final Documentation Post**: December 11 11:59pm
1. Video with people
2. Limited process photos
3. Written description
4. Final photographs

In general, this is the documentation that you want for your portfolio.
