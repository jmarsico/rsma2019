### Pre-Project Exercise - Due October 23
Develop a generative audio piece for a religious site. The audio piece should be never ending, and be able to play forever.
Considerations:
* sample-based, using pre-recorded sounds
* filtered noise
* rhythmic or non-rhythmic

### Precedent Study - Due October 23
* Identify an architectural or media-driven installation that focuses on spirituality, religion or worship
* If you choose a purely architectural example, it must use light, sound, or motion in an experiential way
* Create a Slack post with images, videos and a brief write-up of what attracts you to the work and an explanation of how the designer used media to add to the goals of the space.
