#### Due: Monday October 8, 6:30pm before class. No late work.

#### Submit to: Groups submit one post to [RSMA 2018: Project 02](http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/pools/project-02-pit-light-installation/) and each student submits a link to that post on [Canvas Project 02](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/6049/assignments/100773), along with a few sentences describing their role and contributions in the group project.

# Introduction

The Pittsburgh International Airport has released an Request for Proposals for artist teams to develop a light-based generative artwork to occupy the central atrium in the air-side terminal. The goal of the artwork should be to welcome new visitors to this vibrant, dynamic city and to define the city as a hub of technology and art. Artworks should meet the following requirements:

- Integrate with the existing architecture.
- Be dynamic in nature, always moving or changing, although not necessarily quickly.
- Act as a calming influence on passengers and guests.

# Design Requirements

- Create a generative animation system (not interactive or sensor-based)
- Output content using PixLite controllers and addressable LEDs
- Design and fabricate housing for lights (no bare LEDs allowed)

# Design Points

- Color.... do you need it? If so, what colors work in this space?
- Speed/Pace... how long will people be seeing this? Should it change quickly or very slowly?
- What kind of diffusion or reflection will work here? Could you rely on some alternative material (dichroics?, mirrors?, fabric?)
- KEEP IT SIMPLE

# Deliverables

Groups must create a working model of their design. The model can be of low fidelity (cardboard, basic shapes), but must communicate their concept. Groups must then create a gallery post containing the following:

- A basic video of the functioning model. Video must be take using a tripod and with a black or white backdrop (you can find one in the IDeATe hallway or the CFA photo studio).
- Low-fidelity sketch/rendering of your project composited into the atrium space of the airport.
- Written explanation of the work. This is not a technical writeup. Describe the motion/animation that you've developed. Describe the physical structure in terms of how it integrates with the existing architecture. Describe the goals of the artwork and how it might affect visitors to the airport.
- Photographs of the model with either:
  - A: A black backdrop
  - B: composited into a photograph of the airport atrium
