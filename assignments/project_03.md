#### Due: Wednesday November 6, 6:30pm before class. No late work.

#### Submit to: Groups submit one post to [RSMA 2019: Project 03](http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/pools/03-meditative-space/) and each student submits a link to that post on [Canvas Project 03](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/11945/assignments/180416), along with a few sentences describing their role and contributions in the group project.

# Introduction

Each group will design and prototype a meditative space that uses coordinated sound and visual media to enhance the functionality of the space. Groups can choose any type of meditative space to focus on, including:

- An existing place of worship
- A new room or space within a religious site
- A meditative or spiritual space within a workplace or academic campus
- A private space dedicated to one's spiritual/mindfulness/religious practice


# Design Requirements

- Create a dynamic sound and visual media system (can be generative, interactive, or data-driven)
- Visual content can be screen-based, projection mapped, or light-based
- Design and fabricate a working model of the project. Emphasis is on the media you're developing, not necessarily on the architecture of the space.


# Deliverables

Groups must create a working model of their design. The model can be of low fidelity (cardboard, basic shapes), but must communicate their concept. Groups must then create a gallery post containing the following:

- A basic video of the functioning model. Video must be take using a tripod and with a black or white backdrop (you can find one in the IDeATe hallway or the CFA photo studio).
- Written explanation of the space. This is not a technical writeup. Describe how your media approach will aide in the user's practice or in the intended functionality of the space. Describe the goals of the space and/or intervention and how it might affect users.
- Photographs of the model with either:
  - A: A black backdrop
  - B: composited into a photograph of the airport atrium
- Presentation and Working Demo in class on November 6th.
  - You will have ONLY 10 MINUTES in class to prepare your demo.
