## Course Description

> How can computation change the way we experience our surroundings? What is the value of creating dynamic spaces? This class will focus on the design and prototyping of reactive spaces. Over the course of several small projects and one large final project, students will learn where, when and how to embed computationally-driven experiences into the built environment. Students will be required to design, render and build experiences and interactions for specific locations and with specific intentions. By the end of the course students should expect to know how to use sensor and API data to manipulate an environment through light, sound and motion output. Previous experience with programming, electronics or fabrication is encouraged, but not required. However, students are expected to learn these skills on their own with minimal in-class instruction.

## Learning Objectives

#### _1. Domain Knowledge_

- Develop a working vocabulary related to media architecture; being able to articulate your opinions on this niche field
- Be able to describe the value of embedding dynamic works into the built environment
- Demonstrate experience in designing prototyping large-scale dynamic works

#### _2. Technical Skills_

- Develop a general knowledge of environmental communication techniques.
- Learn to work with basic dynamic content software
- Control commercial lighting fixtures using live data
- Create custom software/hardware solutions for site specific works
- Learn to work with physical computing hardware including microcontrollers and sensors

#### _3. Collaborative Prototyping_

- Collaborate with students from different disciplines; leveraging unique domain knowledge to create more comprehensive prototypes.
- Learn from students of different disciplines, pulling their knowledge into your personal practice.
- Develop quick, to-the-point prototypes of large-scale installations.

## Prerequisites

The course does not have any prerequisites. Although a basic understanding of physical computing, rapid physical prototyping and/or programming will be useful in group projects.

## Instructional Methods

Students will learn through the design and completion of multiple themed projects. Classes will also include readings, discussions of precedent research, technical workshops and group critiques.

## Small Projects

The course revolves around four small projects each focused on exploring different themes, media and intent. Projects will be a mix of group and individual efforts. Small project range between one and two weeks long and culminate in a group presentation/critique session and documentation post to the [Gallery]({{site.gallery}}).

## Final Project

The final five weeks of the course focus entirely on a final group project. The final project will be a site-specific work that must be installed off campus. The goal of the final project is to leverage of the technical and design knowhow acquired during the course and apply it to a large-scale physical work. Students will need to work directly with landowners and other external stakeholders.

## Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is expected at all time. Carnegie Mellon has a established as well-defined policy on this subject which can be found [here](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm).

It is the responsibility of the student to verse themselves with these policies. All necessary and appropriate sanctions will be issued to all parties involved with plagiarizing any and all course work. Plagiarism and any other form of academic dishonesty that is in violation with these policies will not be tolerated.

## Plagiarism

Students are expected to document and credit any code or technique that they've incorporated into their project. This course focuses on fast prototyping and invites students to find solutions to technical problems _before_ trying to develop a custom solution. In doing so, students should feel comfortable commenting any code or design that they've found on the internet or from other students.
On the other hand, creative plagiarism is strictly forbidden. Students will not be rewarded for stealing ideas or copying projects from other students, artists, researchers or companies.

## Information about IDeATe

Facilities: Most IDeATe facilities are located in Hunt Library. Lending, Physical Computing Lab, Media Lab, the laser cutters, 3D printers, woodshop, and CNC router are on the lower level. Some of the equipment requires special training which you will receive either in the class that requires it or in a micro course. If you are unsure of how to operate any of the equipment or are unsure how to use the equipment safely and effectively, please send email to help@ideate.cmu.edu.

**Safety:** Report all fires and emergencies immediately to University Police at 412-268-2323.

**Emergency response:** University Police — 412-268-2323

**Building maintenance:** Facilities Management & Campus Services — 412-268-2910

**IDeATe-related inquiries** — help@ideate.cmu.edu

**IDeATe Lending:** Once you are enrolled in an IDeATe course, you will have access to IDeATe Lending. You will maintain your access through the rest of your time at Carnegie Mellon. You must present your CMU ID each time you borrow an item. You will also be able to purchase a limited number of consumable items (such as plywood and acrylic) for projects. Please visit [the lending website](https://resources.ideate.cmu.edu/lending/) for more detailed information on available resources, to review the IDeATe Lending Borrower Policy, and to find hours of operation.

**Classroom and Lending access:** If you are enrolled in an IDeATe class at least a week before the start of the course, you will have access to IDeATe Lending and (if applicable) have keycard access to the classroom door on the first day of class. If you add a course during the Add Period, you may need to wait a few business days to receive access while the lists are updated. If you add a course after the last day of the Add Period, email help@ideate.cmu.edu with your name, Andrew ID, and course number so we can add you to our systems.

**Laser cutter access:** If you are required to use the laser cutters for this class, you have provisional access for the duration of the class. Until you have been trained on the use of the Rabbit laser cutters and have completed the fire safety requirements, you may only use the laser cutters under the continuous supervision of your instructor, TA, or other qualified person. To maintain access to the laser cutters after your class is over, you must complete Environmental Health & Safety training on Fire Extinguisher Use, Parts 1 and 2, available at [here](https://cmu.bioraft.com/).

**IDeATe advising:** If you have questions or need advice about IDeATe minors or courses, please get in touch with Kelly Delaney, the Assistant Director of IDeATe. Her office is in Hunt 246 and her email is kellydel@andrew.cmu.edu.
