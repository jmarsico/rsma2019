<p class="message">
	tl;dr; Make this class worth your time; create work that either forces you to advance your technical abilities or is of a high enough quality to include in your portfolio. Ideally your projects can fulfill both of those requirements. 
</p>

This is a project-based course that doesn't work unless all students participate. To get a good grade you'll need to:

- Come to class and show up on time
- Participate in discussions, in-class exercises and crits
- Turn in work on time. No exceptions.
- Push yourself: you'll be graded on your effort to improve, not on the skills with which you entered.
- Take time to research meaningful projects and techniques. Share that research!
- Be open to new techniques
- Make the best work you can

Most importantly, make work that you're proud of. Technique is important, but specific technical know-how is not. Be resourceful, if you can't accomplish your initial idea with your current skillset and alloted time, try another approach. You are smart and creative, don't get bogged down on technical roadblocks (that is what we are here for).

# Grading

All graded assignements need to have a digital record to be considered "delivered". This may mean posting a link or reading response to Canvas, creating a post in the [Gallery]({{site.gallery}}) or posting work in [Slack]({{site.slack}}).

The course consists of a mix of individual and group work. For group projects, you will be asked to post a brief description of your contribution to the project in Canvas. This will help the instructors grade more fairly.

## Grading Breakdown

## Participation

Talking in class isn't for everyone; there are several ways to participate in the course that don't involve raising your hand. Participation in this class includes:

- involvement in class discussions
- involvement on Slack: answering technical questions, asking critical questions about Precedent Research, contributing to critical conversations
- involvement during in-class exercises

Participation does not mean raising your hand to ramble, pontificate or philosophize. Our class time together is brief so please be considerate of everyone's time.
