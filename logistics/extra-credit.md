##Extra Credit Tutorial:
You have the opportunity to share your knowledge and earn some extra credit by creating a tutorial based around something you’ve learned throughout the course. The tutorial topic can be about an interesting library that you’ve used, a programming best practice that you’ve learned, tips for working with electronics, integration of another programming language, etc. The options are endless, so be creative. The tutorial CANNOT be a tutorial that was covered in class or listed on the course lab website.

In order to earn the extra credit, the topic must first be approved by one of the professors. You then need to create a project in the extra credit ideate gallery and post a link to that project in canvas. Finally, you must present your idea to the class. Please work with one of the professors at least a week in advance when scheduling your presentation.

Completion of this assignment will result in an extra 50 points added to your Precedent Research grade, which is worth 10% of your overall grade. If you have completed all of the discoveries, you can therefore earn a total of 300 out of 250 points for the discovery portion of the grade.
