## Course Description

> How can embedded computation change the way we experience our surroundings? What is the value of creating dynamic spaces? This class will focus on the design and prototyping of reactive spaces. Over the course of several small projects and one large final project, students will learn where, when and how to embed computationally-driven experiences into the built environment. Students will be required to design, render and build experiences and interactions for specific locations and with specific intentions. By the end of the course students should expect to know how to use sensor and API data to manipulate an environment through light, sound and motion output. Previous experience with programming, electronics or fabrication is encouraged, but not required. However, students are expected to learn these skills on their own with minimal in-class instruction.

## Logistics

1. We use [Slack]({{site.slack}}) as our primary communication channel. We use it to post precedent research, ask technical questions, collaborate on group projects. It is the preferred method for contacting the instructor and TA as well. Please [Download](https://slack.com/downloads) the app for phone and computer if you don't already have it.

2. We use the [IDeATe Gallery]({{site.gallery}}) to post project documentation. Beautiful, well-articulated and informative documentation is a central pillar of this course. Guidelines and expectactions for project documentation can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/deliverables/documentation)

3. [Bi-Weekly Precedent Research]({{site.baseurl}}/deliverables/precedent) should be completed by Wednesday before class and posted to the "Precedent" channel in our [Slack]({{site.slack}}).

4. It's your responsibility to be familiar with the [course policies and standards]({{site.baseurl}}/logistics/syllabus/) found in the full syllabus. If you cannot attend classes make sure you know what to do.

5. No late work accepted. Please don't ask.
